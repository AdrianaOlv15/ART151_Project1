Description:

Originally, my idea was to do an animation similar to rain drop, but as I kept coding my idea transformed into something else. 

Water drops appear randomly, and they form a series of centric circles around the point where they hit the water. Based on this concept, I decided to draw circles with a bulls-eye-like pattern at random places on the canvas that slowly fade in the background.

Water drops are transparent, but to make it more interesting I decided to use 3 different ranges of colors: shades between blues and greens, between yellow and orange, and between pink and purple. 

There's one thing that should be noted. The only way for the water drops to change color is if the user click on the one water-drop that constantly appear in the center of the canvas whose size never changes, and whose colors are totally random and not in shades of specific colors like the ones around it. Furthermore, despite assigning random locations to the surrounding water drops, they aren't totally random. I calculated the spaces so the drops would never touch the one water drop in the middle. 

My intention of leaving one single water drop in the center whose color is different and whose size is constant it was to create a contrast against the water drops that surround it that are a different color, different sizes, and appear at random places. 

After looking at the patterns I had created, I felt my piece had too much randomness, so to create a second contrast I decided to add another element that was constant and predictable: a white ball, bouncing from wall to tall, leaving a trace of it's route. I chose white because this also contrasts with the black background.
